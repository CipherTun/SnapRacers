class_name Conditions
extends RefCounted

## The weather and the time of day for a race. They're picked before it
## starts and stay the same all race. Left to chance, they suit the course:
## snowy courses mostly snow, the Alps often, deserts get dust storms and
## never rain, canyons are mostly clear with dust and hardly any rain, jungles
## often rain or fog and never snow, and beaches are mostly sunny. Halls are always the same, since they're indoors.
##
## A race's conditions travel online as a dictionary, worked out once by the
## host, so everyone races in the same weather with the same puddles.
