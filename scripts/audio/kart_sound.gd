class_name KartSound
extends Node3D

## What a kart sounds like as it drives: its engine, its tires squealing when
## it slides, a rumble on grass and dirt, and (for the karts people drive)
## the wind. It also plays the knocks and crashes, and any one shot sound
## that should follow the kart around goes on it too (see Sounds.play_at).
##
## The engine is a loop of that kind of engine running (see sound/engine),
## pitched up as the kart speeds up. A kart with more than one engine sounds
## like its most powerful one, and a jet roars on top of whatever else it's
## got.
##
## It's all worked out from what the kart's doing, so a kart driven over the
## network would sound the same.
