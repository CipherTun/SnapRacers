extends Node3D

## A driver's model, built from a CharacterDesign, and the thing that poses it.
## It's a brick figure, with a round head with its face printed on, a flat fronted
## torso that's narrower at the shoulders, hips, two leg blocks with feet
## sticking out the front and short arms with C shaped hands. Every piece is
## modelled in tools/characters and listed in data/characters/pieces_made.json.
##
## It's a little cuter than a toy figure, with a bigger head, more rounded
## blocks, shiny plastic and a face with big shiny eyes and rosy cheeks.
##
## The bare figure (hips, legs, torso, neck, arms, hands and the stud on the
## head) is modelled in tools/characters, which writes its numbers to
## data/characters/figure.json; the constants here have to match them. Once
## built, each bone's pieces are baked into one mesh (see CharacterMesh).
##
## It moves the way a brick figure does. The legs only hinge at the hips, so sitting
## they stick straight out in front. The arms are rigid with a fixed bend at
## the elbow and only swing at the shoulder, and the hands twist at the wrist.
## To hold a steering wheel each arm swings to the angle that brings its hand
## closest to the rim.
##
## A lively one (in a race or on the driver screen) blinks, pulls faces, looks
## at karts beside it and cheers when it wins, and standing it fidgets, looks
## around and waves now and then. Pictures stay still. On a podium they can
## also jump up onto a step, clap, sulk, or hold something up in one hand.
##
## Astride a motorbike's saddle, the legs swing down toward the footpegs
## instead of out in front, the upper body leans forward and the arms swing
## out to the sides as well, to reach wide bars.
##
## The origin is where the driver sits, in the middle of the bottom of the
## hips, and they face -Z. Standing, the feet are FEET_BELOW under the origin.
