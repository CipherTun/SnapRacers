## On-screen controls for a phone or tablet, with two ways to steer (see
## STEERING) picked in Settings.
##
## The steering stick sits on the left, two fifths of the way up the screen
## where your thumb holds the phone (a quarter in a split screen half, see
## HEIGHT). Put your thumb anywhere on it and the knob goes where your thumb
## is, and it springs back to the middle when you let go. On the right at the
## same height is a big GO button with the brake right under it, the gadget
## buttons up and to the left, a look back button up and to the right that
## you hold, and a small reset button up top. You can slide a finger from GO
## down to the brake without lifting it, which keeps the gas on too and slides
## the kart around a corner, up onto a gadget, which uses it and keeps GO
## held, or up onto look back, which looks behind you with the gas still on.
##
## Instead of the stick there can be a left and a right button that steer all
## the way while you hold them, and you can slide your thumb from one to the
## other.

## They all keep clear of a camera hole. They move in groups (the steering,
## the pedals with the gadgets and look back, and reset), each group sliding
## together by as little as clears the hole, so nothing ends up on top of
## anything else.

## The ways to steer, and what Settings calls them.
